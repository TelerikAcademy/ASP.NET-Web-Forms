# ASP.NET Web Forms Intro Homework

1. Create a simple ASPX page that enters a name and prints `"Hello" + name` in the page. Use a `TextBox` + `Button` + `Label`.
2. Start Visual Studio and create new Web Forms App. Look at the files generated and tell what's purpose of each file. Explain the "code behind" model. Print "Hello, ASP.NET" from the C# code and from the `aspx` code. Display the current assembly location by `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location`.
3. Dump all the events in the page execution lifecycle using appropriate methods or event handlers.
