# ASP.NET User Controls
1. Create a user control that visualizes a menu of links. The control should have a property to initialize the menu links (a list of items, each containing a title and URL). Use `DataList` and data binding to visualize the menu links. Implement a property to change the font and the font color. Don’t use the `Menu` control!
2. `*` Create a custom control to display an analog clock based on the HTML 5 canvas (you could take some code from http://randomibis.com/coolclock/). Define a property to change the time zone. Allcontrol assets (CSS, images, scripts, etc.)should be loaded dynamically at runtimewhen the control is rendered.
